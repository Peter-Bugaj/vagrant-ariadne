<p><strong>Ariadne is in active development at Myplanet Digital, and should be
considered beta code. Although we dogfood the project, stability and
full documentation is not yet guaranteed.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://github.com/myplanetdigital/ariadne">https://github.com/myplanetdigital/ariadne</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Ariadne is a standardized virtual machine (VM) development environment
for easily developing Drupal sites in a local sandbox that is
essentially identical to a fully-configured hosted solution. It attempts
to emulate a dedicated Acquia/Pantheon server as closely as possible,
with added development tools. Once several simple system requirements
have been met, it can be set up using only a few commands from your
computer's terminal.</p>

<p>The current iteration aims to create a local Vagrant environment that mimics Acquia's
infrastructure as closely as possible, using cookbooks and roles that can easily be
used to deploy an actual cluster.</p>

<p>Tested on Mac OSX Snow Leopard &amp; Lion and Ubuntu 12.04 (should work on
other flavours of Linux).</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Vagrant uses Virtualbox to boot a stripped-down VM image, and then uses
the Chef configuration management tool (one of the few components
installed on the VM initially) to bring that blank slate into a fully
configured state.</p>

<p>The VM will be configured identically whether installed on Mac or Linux.
(Theoretically, Vagrant supports Windows as well, although Ariadne
is untested in this respect.)</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p><em>Tested versions in parentheses.</em></p>

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a> (v1.15.8) - Dealt with in "Quick Start" below</li>
</ul><p>For Ubuntu, you'll need to install the following packages:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libreadline5 libreadline-gplv2-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev nfs-common nfs-kernel-server
</code></pre>

<p>For Ubuntu, you'll need to install the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>build-essential (11.5ubuntu2)</li>
<li>libssl-dev (1.0.1-4ubuntu5.2)</li>
<li>libreadline5 (5.2-11)</li>

<li>nfs-common (1:1.2.5-3ubuntu3)</li>
<li>nfs-kernel-server (1:1.2.5-3ubuntu3)</li>
</ul><h2>Quick Start</h2>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<pre><code>$ curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s 1.15.8    # Install/Update RVM
$ rvm reload                             # Reloads RVM
$ git clone https://github.com/myplanetdigital/ariadne.git
$ cd ariadne                             # rvmrc script will run
$ rake setup                             # Runs first-time setup commands
</code></pre>

<p>You're now set up and ready to boot a machine. This can be either a demo
site, or a specific project.</p>

<h3>Booting</h3>

<p>Ariadne can be used to boot a simple <strong>demo</strong> or an <strong>Ariadne project</strong>.
Instructions for each are given in the following sections, but first
we'll note a few general items that apply to any approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After the demo or project-specific VM has spun up, here are several
commands that might be useful:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake send_gitconfig                    # Send your personal gitconfig to VM
$ vagrant ssh-config &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/config    # OPTIONAL: Adds entry to ssh config
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>vagrant up</code> command will take quite some time regardless, but
it will take longer on the first run, as it must download a basebox
VM image, which can be several hundred MB.</p></li>
</ul><h4>Demo</h4>

<p>If you'd like to spin up the demo site (currently a simple Drupal
install), just run this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations! You now have a configured server image on your local
machine, available at <a href="http://example.dev">http://example.dev</a>!</p>

<h4>Ariadne Project</h4>

<p>Since Ariadne can also be used to spin up specific Ariadne projects, you
can also run this with a <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls">Git URL</a> pointing to an Ariadne
project repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ rake "init_project[GITURL]"
$ project=PROJECTNAME vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>An Ariadne project is basically a Chef cookbook to take the VM through
the last mile of project-specific configuration. An example of an
Ariadne project cookbook is available in the
<code>cookbooks-projects/example</code> folder of this project, which is run when
setting up the demo site above.</p>

<p>The Rake command in the code above clones the specified repository into the
<code>cookbooks-projects</code> folder (removing the <code>ariadne-</code> from the new directory
name if it exists). This folder is shared with the guest machine. The
<code>project=PROJECTNAME</code> tells Chef which folder in <code>cookbooks-projects</code> to use
for the final provisioning step.</p>

<p>For simple Drupal projects, you could copy the <code>cookbooks-override/ariadne</code>
folder and use it as a basis for your own Ariadne project.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use your preferred tools from the local host machine
(Drush, IDE, etc.)</li>
<li>Changes should be immediately observable in browser</li>
<li>Implement as little server configuration as possible that is specific
to the Vagrant environment. It will strive to be as "production-like"
as possible.</li>
<li>Configured with advanced performance tools (Varnish,
Memcache, APC, etc.)</li>
<li>Configured with Percona, the drop-in MySQL replacement used by
enterprise Drupal hosting providers.</li>
<li>Configured with debugging tools (xhprof, xdebug, webgrind)</li>
<li>Provision VM as quickly as possible (persistent shared folders for
caches)</li>
</ul><h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Incredibly standardized environment</h3>

<p>We've tried to lock everything down as much as possible, to ensure that
when one user encounters an issue, we all encounter it together. Here
are the tools we've used:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Recommended version of Virtualbox</strong> to boot the virtual machines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Standard baseboxes</strong> reliably built with <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee#readme">Veewee</a>, an
automated basebox-building tool.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</strong> to ensure a specific ruby version.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bundler</strong> to ensure specific versions of critical gem packages and
their dependencies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Librarian</strong> to ensure specific versions of Chef cookbooks are
used, which in turn ensures identical VM configuration.</li>
</ul><h3>SSH agent forwarding</h3>

<p>Your host machine's SSH session is forwarded into the VM, so when you
SSH in or run Chef, the system will have all the same access that you
have on your host machine. In other words, if you can clone a git repo
or SSH into a remote machine from your host machine, you'll be able to
do it on the VM as well. Wahoo!</p>

<h3>Persistent apt cache</h3>

<p>Every time Vagrant provisions a machine, the VM must redownload all the
software packages using the apt package manager. Normally the VM caches
all the downloaded files in a special directory, but this directory is lost
whenever a VM is destroyed and rebuilt. For this reason, we share the
directory in <code>tmp/apt/cache</code>, so it will persist between VM builds.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/BerlinVagrant/vagrant-dns#readme">vagrant-dns server</a></h3>

<p><strong>OSX only!</strong></p>

<p>Built-in DNS server for resolving vagrant domains. Server stops
and starts with VM itself, and it can be easily uninstalled (see
vagrant-dns README).</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a broken system state related to URL's that
aren't resolving, there's a rake task to restart vagrant-dns. (You can
list all rake tasks using <code>rake -T</code> or <code>rake -D</code>.)</p>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>Should you pull changes or switch branches, you'll very likely need to
rerun the setup. At the very least, you should exit and re-enter the
ariadne directory so that RVM will rerun the <code>.rvmrc</code> script, where some
setup happens. You should then run <code>rake setup</code> again.</p>

<p>If you want to be extra sure that you're running in the same environment
that your version of Ariadne was tested on, rerun the RVM setup script,
then open a new shell. (The version of RVM that Ariadne was tested on
might vary, and this ensure you're using the exact same one.) You can
also ensure that you're using the recommended version of Virtualbox,
verifiable in this README.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><a name="note-vbox"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Be sure to install your version's matching "Extension Pack" from the
download page, as it contains the correct version of the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp5980192">Virtualbox
Guest Additions</a> package. This provides utlities intended to
be installed on any VM running on VBox. Thankfully, we'll be using a
<a href="https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest#readme">Vagrant plugin called vbguest</a>, which will handle
copying this package into any VM that is out of date.
<a name="note-gcc-installer"></a>
</li>
<li>Xcode should also work (as opposed to just the OXS GCC installer),
although it will not always be fully tested.</li>
<li>For the demo, the default password is set to "admin" during
site-install. Also, while the local site can send mail to actual
email addresses, the default email for admin is set to
<code>vagrant@localhost</code>, so that any sent mail will be readable at
<code>/var/mail/vagrant</code> in the VM. This default is mainly to prevent
site-install errors, and can be edited via the admin user's account
page.</li>
<li>Several configuration settings can be tweaked in the
<code>config/config.yml</code>: <code>project</code>, <code>basebox</code>, <code>memory</code>, <code>cpu_count</code>.
Alternatively, any one of these can also be set on the command line
while running vagrant commands, and the values will be written into
<code>config.yml</code>. For example: <code>memory=2000 cpu_count=4 vagrant reload</code> will
reload the VM using 4 cores and with 2GB of RAM.</li>
<li>These is a special environment variable that can be set for use
during any vagrant command that results in a chef run: <code>clean=true
vagrant provision</code>. It is up the each external ariadne project cookbook
to implement this feature, but the intention is that it makes it simpler
to wipe out any data directories needed to rebuild the site.  For
example, <code>vagrant provision</code> will not run <code>drush make</code> and <code>drush
site-install</code> when it detects that the docroot is already present, but
setting the <code>clean=true</code> variable can tell chef to delete the docroot,
and so the site will be rebuilt as it was during the first chef run.</li>
<li>
<p>If your project's individual ariadne cookbook (for last-mile
configuration) has implemented it, you can specify the branch of
your project to build:</p>

<pre><code>branch=123-story-description clean=true vagrant provision
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that the <code>branch</code> flag might not have any effect in
some case, such as the default <code>example</code> project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several baseboxes that are presumed to work for Ariadne are
available for use: <code>lucid32</code> &amp; <code>lucid64</code>. (More may be added to
<code>config/baseboxes.yml</code> in the future.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ariadne's DNS resolver is set up to send all <code>*.dev</code> domains to the
localhost, ie. Vagrant.</p></li>
<li><p>Ariadne uses agent forwarding to forward the host machine's ssh
session into the VM, including keys and passphrases stored by
ssh-agent. What this means is that your VM will have the same Git/SSH
access that you enjoy on your local machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard MySQL port <code>3306</code> inside the VM has been forwarded to
port <code>9306</code> on the local machine. This was done to avoid conflicts
on systems with <code>3306</code> is already in use by MySQL on the local machine.
When the VM is booted, you may connect your MySQL GUI to port <code>9306</code> to
access the VM's MySQL directly.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If your <code>config/config.yml</code> file is showing up as altered when
running <code>git status</code>, and you'd like git to [un]ignore it locally:</p>

<pre><code>git update-index --[no-]assume-unchanged config/config.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul><h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Having dnsmasq installed on the host computer can lead to unexpected
behavior related to <code>resolv.conf</code> in the VM. This will manifest as a
failure to upgrade chef (via rubygems) during boot, right off the bat.</li>
<li>Various issues like DNS, network connectivity, easy gitconfig setup,
etc.  can be dealt with using the various rake tasks. To see all the
available tasks and their descriptions, run <code>rake -T</code> (for short
descriptions) or <code>rake -D</code> (for full descriptions).</li>
<li>When <code>cd</code>ing into non-root of project directory, for example
<code>ariadne/data</code>, <code>.rvmrc</code> will create new directories relative to
that dir. See notes in the <code>.rvmrc</code> for info on why normal bash script
approach is avoided.</li>
<li>It seems that some network connections (seems to be Rogers-related),
will result in misconfigurations of <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> in the VM. If
your VM is unable to download packages or run <code>apt-get update</code>, please
compare the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> of the VM with that on your host computer
(which presumeably works fine). Copy the relevant bits from your host
machine. Working on sorting out the origins of this.</li>
<li>Oh god. The lucid64 basebox is 64 bit, so you must have a system
running in 64-bit mode in order to boot it. Some models of 64-bit
Macbooks will boot to 32-bit mode by default. Please run <code>uname -m</code> and
ensure the system architecture is <code>x86_64</code>. (Alternatively, <code>i386</code>
indicates 32-bit mode.) <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3773">This Apple knowledgebase
article</a> should help you configure your machine
correctly if it's not already.</li>
<li>
<p>Ariadne has been tested with a lucid64 basebox that was built on
<strong>2012-05-07T21:00:04Z</strong>. Please consider downloading a newer build
if yours is out of date. To see when your basebox was built, run this
command:</p>

<pre><code>$ sed -n 's/.*lastStateChange="\(.*\)".*/\1/p' ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/lucid64/box.ovf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>LogMeIn Hamachi is known to cause issues with making <code>pear.php.net</code>
unreachable, and so the environment won't build.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes you might get an error like this while running <code>vagrant up</code>:</p>

<pre><code>The VM failed to remain in the "running" state while attempting to boot.
This is normally caused by a misconfiguration or host system incompatibilities.
Please open the VirtualBox GUI and attempt to boot the virtual machine
manually to get a more informative error message.
</code></pre>

<p>Should this occur, running <code>vagrant reload</code> seems to skirt the issue.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>To Do</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/myplanetdigital/ariadne/issues">https://github.com/myplanetdigital/ariadne/issues</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Doc the need to refresh browser for DNS <strong>or</strong> run dns rake task
first.</li>
<li>Create sister project to provide a base install profile that is
pre-configured to use the advanced components (Memcache, Varnish,
etc.) In progress: <a href="https://github.com/myplanetdigital/2ndleveldeep#readme">2ndleveldeep</a>
</li>
<li>Either avoid using the confusing word "host" (vs "guest" VM) to
describe local machine, or define terminology somewhere.</li>
<li>Add proper string support using <code>i18n</code> gem.</li>
<li>Convert to rubygem?</li>
<li>Convert example project to use <code>drush qd --no-server</code>.</li>
</ul><h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Ariadne is being developed using the <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow#readme">git-flow tool</a> and
methodology. The take-home message is that pull requests should be
submitted to the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>

<p>Here's the gist of how we're applying it:</p>

<ul>
<li>New features happen on <code>develop</code> branch, not <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>Release branches are created in preparation for a tagged release,
and only bugfixes happen on release branches.</li>
<li>When it seems all bugs are fixed on release branch, it's merged into
<code>master</code>, tagged, and the release branch is removed.</li>
<li>When developing new features on <code>develop</code>, feature branches are
recommended.</li>
